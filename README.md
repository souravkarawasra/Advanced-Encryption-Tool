# ADVANCED ENCRYPTION TOOL


A simple yet powerful Python-based **AES-256 file encryption and decryption tool** with a clean GUI interface and **drag-and-drop support**.

This tool allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt files using strong cryptographic algorithms with password protection â€” all without writing a single command!

---

## Features

-  AES-256-bit encryption using the `cryptography` library
-  Secure password input and confirmation
-  Drag and Drop file support (via `tkinterdnd2`)
-  Supports any file type (text, image, PDF, etc.)
-  No command-line usage needed â€” full GUI
-  Cross-platform (Windows/Linux)

## How It Works

### **Encryption Process**
1. User selects or drags a file into the GUI.
2. Tool asks for a **password** and **confirmation**.
3. Generates a random **salt** and **IV (Initialization Vector)**.
4. Derives a strong 256-bit AES key using `PBKDF2HMAC` from the password + salt.
5. Encrypts the file using AES in **CFB mode**.
6. Saves the output file as:  


### **Decryption Process**
1. Drag or select a `.enc` file.
2. Enter the password used during encryption.
3. Extracts salt + IV from the encrypted file.
4. Derives the same AES key.
5. Decrypts the file and saves as:
